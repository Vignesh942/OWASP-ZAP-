#  CSP Misconfiguration Exploit - Web Security Testing

## üìñ Overview  
This project demonstrates how the absence of a **Content Security Policy (CSP)** can lead to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks** and **UI modification** on a vulnerable web application.  

Using **OWASP ZAP**, I identified a **missing CSP header** and exploited it by injecting JavaScript to modify the webpage.

---

##  Tools Used  
- **OWASP ZAP** (Automated vulnerability scanning)  
- **Web Browser (Developer Console - F12)**  
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) for testing**  

---

##  Vulnerability Details  
### **‚ùå Issue: CSP Header Not Set**
- The application does **not implement a CSP header**, making it vulnerable to **XSS attacks**.
- This allows **attackers to inject JavaScript** that can alter the page, steal data, or perform phishing attacks.

### ** Exploit - Injected JavaScript Code**
I modified the website‚Äôs UI by injecting the following script in the browser console:  
```javascript
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
document.body.innerHTML = '<h1>Hi your website has been hacked!!!!</h1>';
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
